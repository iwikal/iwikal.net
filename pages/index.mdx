# Hi! I'm Joel Nordström.
Also known as _iwikal_, which stands for "I wish I knew a language".
Welcome to my personal website!

## About me

I'm employed at [PLAYipp](https://playipp.com/en) where I'm part of a small
team of full-stack developers making a platform for employee communication,
mostly in TypeScript, targeting web and mobile clients.  At the moment I'm on a
leave of absence to attend university.

Some of the things I like doing in my spare time:
 - vegan cooking 🥦
 - playing music 🎵
 - tinkering with Arch Linux 🐧
 - bicycling 🚲
 - hiking 🥾
 - contributing to open source software, especially in Rust 🦀

I am a certified Soydev™. This MF'in website was made with React and a trillion
other dependencies. However, I have at least a slight predisposition towards
simplicity and being economical with computer resources, so I tried to make
the website decently small and work almost as well without javascript as
it does with.
