# I've got syntax highlighting now!

It was easier than I thought it would be. All I did was search the web for "mdx
syntax highlighting" and found [this helpful article in the mdxjs
documentation](https://mdxjs.com/guides/syntax-highlighting).
It lists two options:
 - composition via the MDXProvider
 - remark plugin

They say it's "typically preferred to take the compositional approach". I don't
know why. Maybe they assume that people expect it to dynamically update the
highlighting if the code is changed on the client side. I don't need it to be
doing any parsing on the client, so I went for the second option. I installed
the plugin with `pnpm add @mapbox/rehype-prism` and added it to the mdx options
parameter in my `next.config.js` file. This is what it looked like after:

```javascript
const path = require('path')
const rehypePrism = require('@mapbox/rehype-prism')
const withMDX = require('@next/mdx')({
  extension: /\.mdx?$/,
  options: {
    rehypePlugins: [rehypePrism],
  },
})
module.exports = withMDX({
  pageExtensions: ['mdx', 'tsx'],
})
```

This should do all the expensive parsing while the markdown file is being
loaded, and what we end up with is a javascript file that exports a React
component, which contains all the stuff it did before like headings,
paragraphs, etc. But when I insert a code snippet, it renders a `<pre>` tag
with a whole bunch of `<span>`s in it, each with one or more css classes
attached to it which lets me style them with a very sensible looking css file.
I started by downloading [a css file from
prismjs.com](https://prismjs.com/download.html) after selecting the languages I
thought I would need, and modified it to my liking. Mostly I just replaced the
hard-coded hex color codes with my variables. An excerpt:

```css
.token.comment,
.token.prolog,
.token.doctype,
.token.namespace,
.token.namespace > .token.punctuation,
.token.cdata {
  transition: var(--color-transition);
  color: var(--comment);
}

.language-tsx .token.tag > .token.script,
.token.operator,
.token.punctuation {
  transition: var(--color-transition);
  color: var(--fg);
}

.token.class-name,
.token.maybe-class-name,
.token.function,
.token.property,
.token.tag,
.token.constant,
.token.symbol,
.token.deleted {
  color: var(--blue);
}

.token.atrule,
.token.keyword {
  color: var(--green);
}

.token.builtin,
.token.class-name.known-class-name,
.token.attr-name {
  color: var(--yellow);
}

/* I'm skipping a few rules here */

.token.comment,
.token.italic {
  font-style: italic;
}
```

General identifiers are not wrapped in spans, so they get the default color.
One exception is, in jsx tags, I think it switches to a parser originally made
for html, which would make sense, but when you have computed attributes with
regular javascript (or typescript) code in them, the identifiers within turned
blue because of the style applied to `.token.tag`.

<pre>
  <code>
    <span className="token tag">
      <span className="token punctuation">{'<'}</span>
      Link <span className="token attr-name">href</span>
      <span className="token punctuation">{'={'}</span>
      props
      <span className="token punctuation">.</span>
      href
      <span className="token punctuation">{'} />'}</span>
    </span>
  </code>
</pre>

I had to add a special case:
`.language-tsx .token.tag > .token.script` should have the normal foreground
color. I ended up adding a few more tweaks like that.

```tsx
<Link href={props.href} />
```

I have one gripe with the prism typescript parser that I didn't manage to solve
though: while the javascript parser applies both a `keyword` and a `nil` class
to `undefined` and `null` alike, allowing you to choose if you want to style it
like other keywords or add a special style, their typescript parser doesn't for
whatever reason. While they technically are keywords, I prefer to see them as
literals and thus would like their color to be consistent with string, number,
and boolean literals. There are already so many keywords in the code, we don't
need two more of them.

```javascript
// javascript
const a = undefined
const b = null
const c = false
const d = ''
```

```typescript
// typescript
const a: undefined = undefined
const b: null = null
const c: boolean = false
const d: string = ''
```

I also think it looks a bit strange when it highlights these keywords the same
in type annotations as it does when they're in value position, but it's only a
regex-based parser so I wasn't expecting miracles.

Overall it was a pleasant experience to implement this. I give this solution an
8/10 and would recommend.
